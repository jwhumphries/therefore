If God exists, how would we know anything about Him? Human reason can perhaps establish God's existence and some basic attributes, but the personal God of theism seems to require something more: revelation.

## General and Special Revelation

Theologians traditionally distinguish two modes of revelation:

**General Revelation**: God reveals Himself through creation, conscience, and history. This revelation is available to all people at all times. Paul speaks of this plainly:

{{scripture ref="Romans 1:19-20" version="ESV"}}19 For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. 20 For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.{{/scripture}}

**Special Revelation**: God reveals Himself through specific acts and words—through prophets, through Scripture, and supremely through Christ. This revelation is particular, given to specific people at specific times.

## Inspiration of Scripture

Christians hold that Scripture is "inspired"—God-breathed. But what does this mean? The classic proof-text is Paul's letter to Timothy:

{{scripture ref="2 Timothy 3:16-17" version="ESV"}}16 All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, 17 that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.{{/scripture}}

But inspiration is understood in different ways:

- **Dictation Theory**: God dictated the words; human authors were mere secretaries
- **Verbal Plenary Inspiration**: Every word is God's word, but through the personalities and styles of human authors
- **Dynamic Inspiration**: God inspired the thoughts; humans chose the words
- **Neo-Orthodox View**: Scripture becomes God's word in the encounter between reader and text

Each view has implications for how we interpret Scripture and how we handle apparent contradictions or difficulties.

## Hermeneutics

Interpretation is not straightforward. We must consider:

- **Genre**: Is this history, poetry, prophecy, apocalyptic?
- **Context**: What did this mean to the original audience?
- **Canon**: How does this passage fit with the whole of Scripture?
- **Tradition**: How has the church historically understood this?

The Reformation principle of *sola scriptura* doesn't mean we interpret Scripture in isolation. It means Scripture is the final authority—but it's read within a community, informed by tradition, guided by the Spirit.

## The Power of Scripture

Regardless of one's theory of inspiration, the psalms capture how believers have experienced Scripture itself:

{{scripture ref="Psalm 119:105-106" version="ESV" format="poetry"}}105 Your word is a lamp to my feet
and a light to my path.
106 I have sworn an oath and confirmed it,
to keep your righteous rules.{{/scripture}}
