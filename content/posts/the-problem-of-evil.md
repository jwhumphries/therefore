summary: "If God is all-good and all-powerful, why does evil exist? This ancient question remains one of the most challenging in philosophy of religion."

The existence of evil presents what many consider the strongest argument against theism.{{cite text="Mackie, J.L. (1955). Evil and Omnipotence. Mind, 64(254), 200-212" url="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2251467"}} The logical problem is deceptively simple: If God is omnipotent, He could prevent evil. If God is omnibenevolent, He would want to prevent evil. Yet evil exists. Therefore, God—at least as traditionally conceived—does not exist.

## The Logical Problem

The argument can be formalized:

1. God is omnipotent (all-powerful)
2. God is omniscient (all-knowing)
3. God is omnibenevolent (all-good)
4. Evil exists
5. An omnipotent being could eliminate evil
6. An omniscient being would know how to eliminate evil
7. An omnibenevolent being would want to eliminate evil
8. Therefore, if God exists, evil would not exist
9. Evil exists
10. Therefore, God does not exist

## Free Will Defense

The most influential response comes from Alvin Plantinga's free will defense.{{cite text="Plantinga, A. (1974). God, Freedom, and Evil. Eerdmans Publishing" url="https://www.amazon.com/God-Freedom-Evil-Alvin-Plantinga/dp/0802817319"}} The argument runs roughly as follows:

God desired to create beings capable of genuine love and moral goodness. But genuine love and moral goodness require freedom—the ability to choose otherwise. A world with free creatures who sometimes choose evil is more valuable than a world of automata who can only do good.

This doesn't explain natural evil—earthquakes, diseases, animal suffering.{{sidenote id="natural-evil"}}The distinction between *moral evil* (caused by free agents) and *natural evil* (caused by nature) is crucial. Some theodicies address one type more successfully than the other.{{/sidenote}} But it addresses moral evil: the suffering caused by human choices.

## Soul-Making Theodicy

John Hick proposed that suffering serves a purpose: it creates the conditions for spiritual growth.{{cite text="Hick, J. (1966). Evil and the God of Love. Harper & Row" url="https://www.amazon.com/Evil-God-Love-John-Hick/dp/0230252796"}} A world without challenge, struggle, or pain would produce shallow, untested souls. The world is a "vale of soul-making," not a hedonistic paradise.

Critics object that the suffering seems disproportionate to any growth it might produce. What spiritual lesson requires childhood leukemia?

## Mystery and Trust

Some theologians simply accept the mystery. We cannot see the whole picture. What appears gratuitous from our limited perspective may serve purposes beyond our comprehension.

This isn't a philosophical answer—it's a statement of faith. But for many believers, it's enough. The relationship with God isn't primarily intellectual; it's personal. And in personal relationships, we sometimes trust without full understanding.
