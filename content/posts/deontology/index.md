summary: "Kant's deontological ethics grounds morality in duty and rational law, not consequences. Some acts are simply wrong, regardless of their outcomes."

If virtue ethics asks "Who should I be?" and consequentialism asks "What outcome should I produce?", deontology asks "What is my duty?"

## The Categorical Imperative

Kant's ethics centers on the categorical imperative—a moral law that binds all rational beings unconditionally. He formulates it several ways:

**Universal Law**: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."

Can you universalize lying? If everyone lied, trust would collapse, and lying itself would become impossible. Lying is therefore self-defeating when universalized—and hence wrong.

**Humanity as End**: "Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end."

People have inherent dignity. Using them merely as tools—even for good outcomes—violates their rational nature.

## Duty vs. Inclination

For Kant, the moral worth of an action lies in its motive. Acting from inclination—because you want to, because it feels good—has no moral worth. Only acting from duty counts.

This seems counterintuitive. Isn't the person who helps others because they love doing so morally superior to the one who helps grudgingly from duty?

Kant would say: both are praiseworthy, but only the dutiful action has moral worth. The loving person would help anyway; the dutiful person helps precisely because it's right.

## Problems and Responses

Critics raise several objections:

- **Rigidity**: Must we always tell the truth, even to murderers asking where our friends hide?
- **Conflicting Duties**: What happens when duties conflict?
- **Cold Rationalism**: Where is love, compassion, emotion in this picture?

Kantians have developed sophisticated responses. Ross's prima facie duties, for instance, allow that duties can be overridden in particular circumstances while maintaining their general binding force.

Despite its challenges, deontology captures something important: some acts seem wrong in themselves, regardless of consequences. The moral universe has constraints that cannot be traded away.
