What makes a thing the thing it is? When a tree loses its leaves, it remains a tree. When it's painted, it remains a tree. But if it's reduced to ash, it's no longer a tree. Aristotle's distinction between substance and accident helps us understand why.

## Substance: What a Thing Is

Substance (Greek: *ousia*) is the fundamental category of being. A substance is a thing that exists in its own right—not as a property of something else.

Socrates is a substance. His height is not—it exists only as a property of Socrates. The number seven is not a substance; nor is redness, nor justice. Only individual things—this man, this horse, this tree—are substances in the primary sense.

## Accident: What a Thing Has

Accidents are properties that a substance has but could lack while remaining the same substance. Socrates is bald, but he could have had hair. He is snub-nosed, but he could have had a straight nose. These are accidents.

Aristotle lists nine categories of accident:
- Quantity
- Quality
- Relation
- Place
- Time
- Position
- State
- Action
- Passion

## Essential vs. Accidental Properties

Some properties are essential—a thing couldn't exist without them. A triangle must have three sides. A human must be rational. These aren't accidents; they're part of what makes the thing the kind of thing it is.

This distinction grounds Aristotle's logic. We can reason about essential properties with certainty; accidental properties require empirical observation.

## The Problem of Change

The substance-accident distinction helps explain change. When Socrates tans, he remains Socrates—a substance persists through accidental change. But when Socrates dies, the substance ceases to exist. The matter remains, but Socrates is gone.

This framework influenced centuries of philosophy and theology. The doctrine of transubstantiation, for instance, uses these categories to explain how bread and wine become Christ's body and blood while retaining their accidental properties.
