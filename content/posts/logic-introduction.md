Philosophy begins with argument. We don't simply assert claims; we give reasons for them. But not all arguments are good ones. Logic is the study of what makes reasoning valid.

## Deductive vs. Inductive

Deductive arguments guarantee their conclusions. If the premises are true and the form is valid, the conclusion must be true. The classic example:

1. All men are mortal
2. Socrates is a man
3. Therefore, Socrates is mortal

If premises 1 and 2 are true, 3 cannot be false.

Inductive arguments merely support their conclusions. The sun has risen every day of recorded history, so it will probably rise tomorrow. But unlike deduction, this isn't guaranteed—the conclusion could be false even if the premises are true.

## Validity vs. Soundness

An argument is **valid** if the conclusion follows from the premises—if the premises couldn't be true while the conclusion is false. Validity is about form, not content.

An argument is **sound** if it's valid and all its premises are true. Soundness guarantees a true conclusion.

This valid argument is unsound:
1. All fish can fly
2. Socrates is a fish
3. Therefore, Socrates can fly

The logic is perfect; the premises are false.

## Common Fallacies

Watch for these errors:

**Ad Hominem**: Attacking the person rather than the argument
**Straw Man**: Misrepresenting the opponent's position
**Appeal to Authority**: Relying on credentials rather than evidence
**False Dichotomy**: Presenting only two options when more exist
**Begging the Question**: Assuming what you're trying to prove

## The Three Laws

Classical logic rests on three fundamental principles:

1. **Identity**: A is A
2. **Non-contradiction**: Nothing is both A and not-A
3. **Excluded Middle**: Everything is either A or not-A

These seem obvious—even trivial. But their denial leads to incoherence. They are the bedrock of rational thought.
