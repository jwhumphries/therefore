Every day we make judgments. This meal is good. That decision was bad. She acted rightly. He behaved wrongly. But what do these words actually mean? When we call something "good," what are we saying about it?

This question has occupied philosophers for millennia, and it remains as pressing today as when Socrates first interrogated the citizens of Athens about their assumptions.

## The Socratic Challenge

Socrates famously claimed to know nothing—except that he knew nothing. Yet this profession of ignorance was itself a kind of wisdom. By acknowledging what we don't know, we open ourselves to genuine inquiry.

The unexamined life is not worth living.

This statement cuts to the heart of ethical inquiry. If we simply accept the values handed to us by society, family, or tradition without examination, are we truly living our own lives? Or are we merely following a script written by others?

## Three Approaches to the Good

Throughout history, philosophers have proposed various answers to the question of what makes something good:

### 1. Virtue Ethics

The ancient Greeks, particularly Aristotle, argued that goodness is about developing excellent character traits—virtues like courage, wisdom, justice, and temperance. On this view, a good person is one who has cultivated these virtues through practice and habituation.

### 2. Deontological Ethics

Immanuel Kant proposed that goodness lies in acting from duty according to universal moral laws. An action is good not because of its consequences, but because it conforms to principles that all rational beings could accept.

### 3. Consequentialism

Thinkers like John Stuart Mill argued that the good is simply what produces the best outcomes—typically understood as maximizing happiness or well-being for the greatest number of people.

## Why This Matters

These aren't merely academic distinctions. The framework we adopt shapes how we approach every moral decision:

- Should I tell a painful truth or a comforting lie?
- Is it right to break a promise to prevent greater harm?
- What do I owe to strangers versus those close to me?

In the posts that follow, we'll examine each of these traditions more closely. But for now, the important thing is to begin asking the question seriously: *What is the good?*

The answer you arrive at will shape everything else.
