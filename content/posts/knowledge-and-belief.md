You believe many things. You believe the sun will rise tomorrow. You believe your memories are generally reliable. You believe other people have minds like yours. But do you *know* these things? And what's the difference?

## The Classical Definition

Since Plato, philosophers have generally defined knowledge as "justified true belief."{{cite alias="plato-theaetetus"}} {{sidenote id="jtb"}}This definition appears in Plato's *Theaetetus*, though Plato himself raises objections to it. The dialogue ends in aporia—philosophical puzzlement—without a definitive answer.{{/sidenote}} To know something, on this account, you need three things:

1. **Belief**: You must actually hold the proposition to be true
2. **Truth**: The proposition must actually be true
3. **Justification**: You must have good reasons for your belief

This seems reasonable enough. If you don't believe something, you can't be said to know it. If what you believe is false, you don't have knowledge—just a mistaken belief. And if you happen to believe something true but for bad reasons (like a lucky guess), that doesn't seem like real knowledge either.

## The Gettier Problem

For over two thousand years, this definition seemed adequate. Then, in 1963, Edmund Gettier published a three-page paper that changed everything.{{cite alias="gettier1963"}} {{sidenote id="gettier"}}Gettier's paper is one of the most influential short papers in the history of philosophy. It spawned an entire industry of responses and counter-examples.{{/sidenote}}

Gettier showed that you can have justified true belief and still not have knowledge. Consider this scenario:

Smith has strong evidence that Jones will get the job, and Smith has counted the coins in Jones's pocket—there are ten. Smith forms the justified belief: "The person who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket."

As it turns out, Smith himself gets the job. And, by sheer coincidence, Smith also has ten coins in his pocket. Smith's belief is true and justified—but does he really *know* it? His belief is true by accident, not because of his justification.

## Skeptical Challenges

Even setting aside Gettier cases, there are deeper challenges to our claims of knowledge:

**The Dream Argument**: How do you know you're not dreaming right now? Dreams can seem completely real while we're in them. What evidence could you possibly have that would distinguish waking life from a very vivid dream?

**The Evil Demon**: Descartes imagined a powerful deceiver who manipulates all your experiences.{{cite alias="descartes"}} Everything you perceive could be an illusion created by this demon. How could you ever rule this out?

**Brain in a Vat**: The modern version of Descartes' scenario. What if you're just a brain in a vat, being fed electrical impulses that simulate an entire world? Your experiences would be indistinguishable from "real" ones.

## Living with Uncertainty

These skeptical scenarios might seem like mere philosophical games, but they point to something important: absolute certainty is harder to come by than we typically assume.

This doesn't mean we should abandon all claims to knowledge. {{sidenote id="pragmatic"}}Many philosophers argue for a more pragmatic approach: knowledge is what works, what allows us to navigate the world successfully. Perfect certainty isn't required.{{/sidenote}} But it should make us humble. The line between knowledge and belief is blurrier than common sense suggests.

In our next installment, we'll turn from how we know to what exists—the fundamental questions of metaphysics.
