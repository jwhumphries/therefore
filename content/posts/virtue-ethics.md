Modern ethical theories typically ask: "What should I do?" Virtue ethics asks a different question: "What kind of person should I be?"

## The Aristotelian Framework

For Aristotle, ethics is about *eudaimonia*—often translated as "happiness" but better understood as "flourishing" or "living well." The good life isn't about following rules or maximizing pleasure; it's about developing excellent character.

Virtues are stable dispositions to act, feel, and think in excellent ways. They're not innate—we develop them through practice. We become just by doing just acts, courageous by doing courageous acts.

## The Golden Mean

Each virtue is a mean between two extremes:

- **Courage** is the mean between cowardice and recklessness
- **Generosity** is the mean between stinginess and prodigality
- **Honesty** is the mean between deception and brutal tactlessness

The mean isn't mathematical—it's relative to circumstances and individuals. What counts as courageous for a soldier differs from what counts as courageous for a child.

## Practical Wisdom

Knowing the right thing to do requires *phronesis*—practical wisdom. This isn't theoretical knowledge; it's the ability to perceive what virtue requires in particular situations.

Practical wisdom can't be reduced to rules. It's developed through experience, through moral exemplars, through reflection on our successes and failures. It's why ethics can't be learned purely from books.

## Character and Community

Virtues are developed in community. We learn them from parents, teachers, friends, and traditions. The solitary individual, cut off from formative relationships, cannot develop good character.

This has implications for political philosophy. A good society isn't just one that protects rights; it's one that forms virtuous citizens. Education is not merely about skills; it's about character formation.

## Contemporary Revival

After centuries of neglect, virtue ethics has experienced a renaissance. Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, and others have argued that modern ethics—both utilitarian and Kantian—is fundamentally misguided. Only by returning to virtue can we make sense of morality.
