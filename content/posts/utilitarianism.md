Utilitarianism offers a seductively simple answer to ethical questions: maximize happiness, minimize suffering. The right action is whatever produces the best consequences overall.

## Bentham's Calculus

Jeremy Bentham proposed a "felicific calculus"—a systematic way to measure pleasure and pain. Consider:

- **Intensity**: How strong is the pleasure/pain?
- **Duration**: How long does it last?
- **Certainty**: How likely is it to occur?
- **Propinquity**: How soon will it occur?
- **Fecundity**: Will it lead to more pleasures?
- **Purity**: Will it lead to pains as well?
- **Extent**: How many people are affected?

Add up the pleasures, subtract the pains, and you have your answer. Ethics becomes arithmetic.

## Mill's Refinements

John Stuart Mill worried that Bentham's version was too crude. "It is better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied." Quality matters, not just quantity.

Mill distinguished higher and lower pleasures. Intellectual pleasures, aesthetic experiences, deep relationships—these are qualitatively superior to bodily pleasures. The competent judge who has experienced both will always prefer the higher.

## The Objections

Utilitarianism faces serious challenges:

**Justice**: What if torturing an innocent person would prevent a war? Utilitarianism seems to permit—even require—injustice when the math works out.

**Integrity**: Bernard Williams argued that utilitarianism alienates us from our own projects and commitments. If I must always maximize overall good, my own life becomes merely a vessel for impersonal utility.

**Demandingness**: Utilitarianism never lets us rest. Every dollar spent on ourselves is a dollar not spent saving lives. Every hour of leisure is an hour not spent working for others.

**Measurement**: Can happiness really be measured and compared across persons? Is there a common currency of well-being?

## Rule Utilitarianism

Some utilitarians retreat to rules: follow rules that, if generally followed, would maximize happiness. This handles many objections—rules against torture, rules protecting individual rights—while maintaining the utilitarian framework.

But critics wonder if this is just deontology in disguise. If the rules have independent force, what's left of utilitarianism?
