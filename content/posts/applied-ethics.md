summary: "How do abstract ethical theories apply to real-world dilemmas? Applied ethics brings philosophy down to earth."

Moral philosophy can seem abstract—arguing about categorical imperatives and hedonic calculus while the world burns. Applied ethics bridges the gap between theory and practice.

## Bioethics

Medical technology creates dilemmas our ancestors never faced:

**Abortion**: When does a fetus acquire moral status? Is the distinction between potential and actual persons morally relevant?

**Euthanasia**: Do patients have a right to die? Is there a moral difference between killing and letting die?

**Genetic Engineering**: Should we edit human embryos? Where do we draw the line between therapy and enhancement?

Each ethical theory yields different answers. Utilitarians weigh consequences; deontologists consider rights and duties; virtue ethicists ask what a person of good character would do.

## Business Ethics

Commerce isn't exempt from morality:

**Corporate Responsibility**: Do companies have obligations beyond profit? To whom are they responsible?

**Advertising**: When does persuasion become manipulation?

**Whistleblowing**: When should loyalty to an organization yield to other moral demands?

The profit motive isn't inherently immoral—but it doesn't override all other considerations.

## Environmental Ethics

The traditional focus on human welfare expands:

**Animal Rights**: Do animals have moral status? If so, what follows?

**Future Generations**: What do we owe people who don't yet exist?

**Nature's Value**: Does the natural world have value independent of human use?

These questions challenge anthropocentric assumptions embedded in most ethical theories.

## The Limits of Theory

Applied ethics reveals the limits of pure theory. Real dilemmas rarely fit neatly into theoretical categories. Competing values clash. Uncertainty abounds. Context matters.

Perhaps this suggests that practical wisdom—Aristotle's phronesis—cannot be replaced by abstract principles. Theory informs but doesn't determine good judgment.
