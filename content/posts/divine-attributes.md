When theologians and philosophers speak of God, they typically ascribe certain properties or attributes. But these terms are more complex than they first appear.

## Omnipotence

God is all-powerful. But what does this mean? Can God create a stone so heavy He cannot lift it? Can God make 2+2=5? Can God do evil?

Most philosophers distinguish between:

- **Absolute omnipotence**: God can do literally anything
- **Logical omnipotence**: God can do anything logically possible

The second view is more defensible. Logical impossibilities aren't "things" God fails to do—they're incoherent word combinations. "A married bachelor" isn't a thing God can't create; it's not a thing at all.

## Omniscience

God knows everything. But does God know what it's like to sin? Does God know the future free choices of creatures? Does God know what would have happened if things had gone differently?

These questions have generated extensive debate:

- **Open Theism**: God knows everything knowable, but future free choices aren't knowable
- **Molinism**: God knows "middle knowledge"—what any free creature would do in any circumstance
- **Classical View**: God exists outside time and sees all moments eternally present{{sidenote id="boethius"}}This view was classically articulated by Boethius in *The Consolation of Philosophy*, where he argues that God's knowledge is not *foreknowledge* but rather an eternal present vision.{{/sidenote}}

## Omnibenevolence

God is perfectly good. But whose standard of goodness? Is something good because God commands it, or does God command it because it's good?

This is the Euthyphro dilemma, and it has profound implications for ethics.{{cite text="Plato, Euthyphro (c. 399-395 BC)" url="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-ethics-shorter/#Euth"}} If God's commands make things good, morality seems arbitrary. If God commands what's independently good, there's a standard above God.

## Simplicity and Immutability

Classical theism also holds that God is simple (without parts) and immutable (unchanging).{{cite text="Aquinas, T. (1265-1274). Summa Theologica, Prima Pars, Q3" url="https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1003.htm"}} These attributes generate further puzzles. How can a simple being have multiple attributes? How can an immutable being respond to prayer?

These are not merely academic questions. Our understanding of divine attributes shapes our entire theology—our understanding of creation, providence, salvation, and eschatology.
