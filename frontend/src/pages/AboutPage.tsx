          <strong>Therefore</strong> is a blog exploring ideas at the
          intersection of philosophy and theology. The name comes from the
          logical connective that links premises to conclusions&mdash;a reminder
          that careful reasoning matters.

          Here you&apos;ll find essays on classical philosophy, theological
          reflection, and the perennial questions that have occupied human minds
          for millennia: What is the good life? What can we know? What ought we
          to do?

        <h2>The Author</h2>
        <p>
          These writings emerge from a lifelong fascination with the great
          thinkers&mdash;from Aristotle to Aquinas, from Augustine to Anselm.
          The goal is not merely academic but practical: to think more clearly
          and live more wisely.
